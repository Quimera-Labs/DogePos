# 🐕 DogePos (DOGEPOS)

**DogePos** is a next-generation hybrid cryptocurrency that combines **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)** into a single, fair, and scalable blockchain protocol.

The project is **100% fair launch**:

* ❌ No premine
* ❌ No instamine
* ❌ No hidden allocations

DogePos is designed to reward early miners, long-term stakers, and late adopters in a balanced way, while progressively increasing network security and decentralization.

## 🔑 Key Features

* Hybrid **PoW + PoS consensus**
* Fair launch (no premine)
* Progressive reward model
* Long-term sustainability
* Energy-efficient staking layer
* Designed for community-driven growth

---

## ⚙️ Consensus Architecture

DogePos uses a **hybrid consensus model**, where:

* **Proof of Work (PoW)** secures the network during early and mid phases
* **Proof of Stake (PoS)** provides long-term security and passive income
* Both mechanisms coexist and evolve according to block height

This approach ensures:

* Strong initial distribution
* Reduced long-term energy consumption
* Economic incentives aligned with holding and securing the network

## ⛏️ Proof of Work (PoW) Reward Schedule

PoW rewards scale aggressively over time to incentivize miners during network growth phases.

| Block Height Range | PoW Reward (DOGEPOS) |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Block 1            | 5                    |
| 2 – 65,000         | 5                    |
| 65,001 – 130,000   | 25                   |
| 130,001 – 195,000  | 250                  |
| 195,001+           | 1,000                |

**PoW Goals:**

* Secure early blocks
* Encourage hash power migration
* Enable fair coin distribution

## 💰 Proof of Stake (PoS) Reward Schedule

PoS rewards increase gradually to promote long-term holding and network participation.

| Block Height Range | PoS Reward (DOGEPOS) |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1 – 65,000         | 1                    |
| 65,001 – 130,000   | 2.5                  |
| 130,001 – 195,000  | 25                   |
| 195,001+           | 100                  |

**PoS Goals:**

* Encourage decentralization
* Reward loyal holders
* Reduce reliance on PoW over time

---

## 📈 Monetary Policy Overview

* Hybrid inflation model
* Early-stage conservative issuance
* Mid-stage expansion for ecosystem growth
* Late-stage high rewards to sustain network security

There is **no premine** and all coins are minted exclusively through:

* Mining (PoW)
* Staking (PoS)

---

## 🛡️ Security Model

* PoW protects against chain rewrites and early attacks
* PoS strengthens finality and long-term stability
* Hybrid model mitigates single-vector attacks

---

## 🌍 Vision & Philosophy

DogePos is built on three core principles:

1. **Fairness** – Everyone starts equal
2. **Longevity** – Incentives designed for decades
3. **Community** – Open-source and permissionless

This is not just another meme coin — **it is a meme-powered protocol with real economic design**.
